The dataset contains images of 49 famous individuals from Nepal, including actors, actresses, singers, and social figures. The individuals vary in age, gender, and profession.

Potential uses for this dataset include face recognition, face detection, emotion recognition, and training machine learning models related to facial analysis.

## Procedure

1. Images of the actors were collected from the internet using a Python script.
2. The `bing_image_downloader` package was used to download images.
3. Images were manually verified for quality and unsuitable ones were removed.
4. OpenCV library was used to detect faces and crop images to extract only the face region.
5. The cropped face images were resized to a standard size.
6. Processed images were saved in a separate directory with appropriate naming convention.
